********* PROBLEM **********

For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars.

departments table schema
id
name
sales table schema
id
department_id (department foreign key)
name
price
card_name
card_number
transaction_date
resultant table schema
id
name
NOTE: sometimes a department will not not contain a sale over $98 so just resubmit.

********** SOLUTION **********

-- Create your SELECT statement here
SELECT * 
FROM departments -- select everything from departments table
WHERE id IN(
      SELECT department_id
      FROM sales
      WHERE price > 98.00) -- where the id (from departments table) is in sales table where price>98
